### Problem 2

``` r
homicide = read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         resolved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest",TRUE, FALSE)) |>
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) |>
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
baltimore = homicide |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
baltimore_model = glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
                      data = baltimore,
                      family = binomial)
broom::tidy(baltimore_model, conf.int = TRUE) |>
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         OR_low = exp(conf.low),
         OR_high = exp(conf.high)) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
  select(OR, OR_low, OR_high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 Ã— 3
    ##      OR OR_low OR_high
    ##   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1 0.426  0.324   0.558

The estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing
male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed is
0.426. The corresponding CI is \[0.324, 0.558\].
